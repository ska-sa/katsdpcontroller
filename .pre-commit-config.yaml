# mypy is configured as a "local" repo so that it has access to the installed
# virtualenv. The alternative is to list all the necessary packages for
# type-checking as additional_dependencies, and without something like
# https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/730 this will lead to
# unwanted duplication.
