"""
Mesos-based scheduler for launching collections of inter-dependent tasks. It
uses asyncio for asynchronous execution. It is **not** thread-safe.

Graphs
------
The scheduler primarily operates on *graphs*. There are two types of graphs:
logical and physical. A logical graph defines *how* to run things, but is not
assigned with any actually running tasks. In many cases, a logical graph can
be described statically, and should not contain any hostnames, addresses, port
numbers etc. The graph itself is simply a :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph`, and
the nodes are instances of :class:`LogicalNode` (or subclasses).

A physical graph corresponds to a specific execution. The nodes in a physical
graph have a lifecycle where they start, run and are killed; they cannot come
back from the dead. To re-run all the processes, a new graph must be created.
A physical graph is generally created from a logical graph by
:func:`instantiate`, but it is also possible to build up a physical graph
manually (by creating :class:`PhysicalNode`s from :class:`LogicalNode`s and
assembling them into a graph). It is even possible to add to a physical graph
later (although some care is needed, as this is not async-safe relative to all
operations).

Nodes
-----
The base class for logical nodes is :class:`LogicalNode`, but it is an
abstract base class. Typically one will use :class:`LogicalTask` for tasks
that are executed as Docker images. For services managed outside the graph,
use :class:`LogicalExternal`. This can also be used for multicast endpoints.

Resolution
----------
Due to limitations of Mesos, the full information about a task (such as which
machine it is running on and which ports it is using) are not available until
immediately before the task is launched. The process of filling in this
information is called *resolution* and is performed by
:meth:`PhysicalNode.resolve`. If the user needs to access or modify this
information before the task is actually launched, it should make a subclass
and override this method.

If only the command needs to be adapted to the dynamic configuration, it might
not be necessary to write any extra code. The command specified in the logical
task is passed through :meth:`str.format` together with a dictionary of
dynamic information. See :attr:`LogicalTask.command` for details.

To aid in resolution, a :class:`Resolver` is provided that is able to allocate
task IDs, image paths, etc. It can be augmented or subclassed to provide extra
tools for subclasses of :class:`PhysicalNode` to use during resolution.

Edges
-----
Edges carry information about dependencies, which are indicated by different
edge attributes. An edge with no attributes carries no semantic information for
the scheduler. Users of the scheduler can also define extra attributes, which
are similarly ignored. The defined attributes on an edge from A to B are:

depends_resources
   Task A needs knowledge of the resources assigned to task B. This will
   ensure that B is started either before or at the same time as A. It is
   guaranteed that B's resources are assigned before A is resolved (but not
   necessarily before B is resolved). It is legal for these edges to form a
   cycle.

depends_resolve
   Task A must be resolved after task B. This implies `depends_resources`.
   These edges must not form a cycle.

port
   Task A needs to connect to a service provided by task B. Set the `port`
   edge attribute to the name of the port on B. The endpoint on B is provided
   to A as part of resolution. This automatically implies
   `depends_resources`.

depends_ready
   Task B needs to be *ready* (running and listening on its ports) before task
   A starts. Note that this only determines startup ordering, and has no
   effect on shutdown. For example, task B might put some information in a
   database before it comes ready, which is consumed by task A, but task A
   does not require B to remain alive. It is an error for these edges to form
   a cycle.

depends_kill
   Task A must be killed before task B. This is the shutdown counterpart to
   `depends_ready`. It is an error for these edges to form a cycle.

Queues
------
The scheduler supports multiple queues, but these aren't quite the same as the
queues in a classic HPC batch system. Each call to :meth:`Scheduler.launch`
targets a particular queue. Concurrent launch requests within a queue are
serviced strictly in order, while launch requests to separate queues may be
serviced out-of-order, depending on availability of resources. Note that jobs
in a queue *can* run in parallel: queues are not a tool to enforce
serialisation of dependent jobs.

The scheduler does not currently scale well with large numbers of queues. Thus,
it is recommended that batch jobs with the same resource requirements are
grouped into a single queue, since there is no benefit to launching out of
order. Batch jobs with very different requirements (e.g. non-overlapping)
should go into different queues to avoid head-of-line blocking.

Queues can also have priorities. As long as there are tasks waiting in a
higher-priority queue, no tasks from a lower-priority queue will be launched,
even if the resources are available for them. This is a crude mechanism to
ensure that a stream of low-priority jobs with minimal resource requirements do
not block high-priority tasks that needs to wait for a more significant portion
of the cluster to be available.

GPU support
-----------
GPUs are supported independently of Mesos' built-in GPU support, which is not
very flexible. Mesos allows only a whole number of GPUs to be allocated to a
task, and they are reserved exclusively for that task. katsdpcontroller allows
tasks to share a GPU, and provides resources for compute and memory. There is
no isolation of GPU memory.

To use this support, the agent must be configured with attributes and
resources. The attribute :code:`katsdpcontroller.gpus` must be a
base64url-encoded JSON string, describing a list of GPUs, and conforming to
:const:`katsdpcontroller.schemas.GPUS`. For the ith GPU in this list (counting
from 0), there must be corresponding resources
:samp:`katsdpcontroller.gpu.{i}.compute` (generally with capacity 1.0) and
:samp:`katsdpcontroller.gpu.{i}.mem` (in MiB).

The node must also provide nvidia-docker-plugin so that driver volumes can be
loaded.

Agent prioritisation
--------------------
Each agent is assigned a 'priority', and tasks are assigned to the
lowest-priority agent where they fit (so that specialised tasks that can only
run on one agent are not blocked by more generic tasks being assigned to that
agent). By default, the priority is the total number of volumes, interfaces and
GPUs it has. This can be overridden by assigning a `katsdpcontroller.priority`
scalar attribute. Ties are broken by amount of available memory.

Setting up agents
-----------------
The previous sections list a number of resources and attributes that need to be
configured on each agent. To simplify this, a script
(:file:`scripts/agent_mkconfig.py`) is provided that will interrogate most of
the necessary information from the system. It assumes that Mesos is run with
system wrappers that source arguments from :file:`/etc/mesos-slave/attributes`
and :file:`/etc/mesos-slave/resources` (this is the case for the Ubuntu
packages; untested for other operating systems).

Note that Mesos slaves typically require a manual `recovery`_ step after
changing resources or attributes and restarting.

        Reserved CPU cores. If this is empty, then the task will not be pinned.
        If it is non-empty, then the task will be pinned to the assigned cores,
        and no other tasks will be pinned to those cores. In addition, the
        cores will all be taken from the same NUMA socket, and network

        The strings in the list become keys in :attr:`Task.cores`. You can use
        ``None`` if you don't need to use the core numbers in the command to
        pin individual threads.

        Network service ports. Each element in the list is a logical name for
        the port.
    interfaces : list
        List of :class:`InterfaceRequest` objects, one per interface requested

        Base name of the Docker image (without registry or tag).
    taskinfo : :class:`addict.Dict`
        A template for the final taskinfo message passed to Mesos. It will be
        copied into the physical task before being populated with computed

        It is legal to pass nodes that have already been passed to

        this call will wait until they are ready.

        It is safe to run this coroutine as an asyncio task and cancel it.

        first launch to be ready.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graph : :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph`
            Physical graph to launch
        resolver : :class:`Resolver`
            Resolver to allocate resources like task IDs
        nodes : list, optional
            If specified, lists a subset of the nodes to launch. Otherwise,
            all nodes in the graph are launched.
        queue : :class:`LaunchQueue`
            Queue from which to launch the nodes. If not specified, a default
            queue is used.
        resources_timeout : float
            Time (seconds) to wait for sufficient resources to launch the
            nodes. If not specified, defaults to the class value.

        Raises
        ------
        asyncio.InvalidStateError
            If :meth:`close` has been called.
        InsufficientResourcesError
            If, once a launch request reached the head of the queue, no
            sufficient resource offers were received within the timeout. Note
            that a call to :meth:`launch` can be split into several phases,
            each with its own timeout, so it is possible for there to be a
